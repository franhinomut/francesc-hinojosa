            <h3>MLOps Server with Airflow, mlflow, Jupyter and Postgres</h3><br>
            
            <p>In this project I use Jupyter to generate pipelines that airflow is able to process. These are the main components of the project,
                <ul>
                    <li> Jupyter, an application that will allow us to run notebooks locally, uses port 8888</li>
                    <li> Airflow, we will use it to manage and handle code pipelines, uses port 8080,</li>
                    <li> mlflow, we will use it to manage machine learning experiments, uses port 5000</li>
                    <li> Postgres, we will use it to storage all the data generated, uses ports 5432, 5433</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
