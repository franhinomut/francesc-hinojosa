            <p>During last year, I focused on immersing myself in the most recent trends and algorithms within AI. My primary concentration was on exploring and developing various business use cases associated with Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>

           <p>I'm in the final stages of creating a personal assistant tailored to enhance my productivity as a data scientist. The initial demonstration will be ready in the upcoming days.</p>

           <p>Prior to that, I constructed various applications to familiarize myself with diverse language models (LLMs) and technologies, laying the foundation for the development of my personal assistant.</p>

           <h3>ChatBot Using Local LLM</h3><br>

           <h4>Exploring RAG using Ollama, LangChain, and Streamlit</h4><br>

           <p>In this project, I explore the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). I build a web app that accepts, through upload, a CSV document and answers questions about that document.</p>

           <h3>Chatbot app using Mistral 7b</h3><br>

           <p>I create a chatbot app using the Mistral 7b Instruct model, a large language model fine-tuned for following instructions. I am going to access it through the Hugging Face API.</p>

           <p>I deploy the chatbot as a Gradio app using Hugging Face space that can be accessed throug this <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/franhinomut/Chatbot-Mistral-7b" target="_blank"> link</a></p>
           
           
           <p>Gradio is an open source Python library that allows you to create interactive web-based interfaces for machine learning models quickly and easily.</p>
