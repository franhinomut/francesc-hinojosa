            <p>During last year, I focused on immersing myself in the most recent trends and algorithms within AI. My primary concentration was on exploring and developing various business use cases associated with Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>

           <p>I'm in the final stages of creating a personal assistant tailored to enhance my productivity as a data scientist. The initial demonstration will be ready in the upcoming days.</p>
