            <p>During last year, I focused on immersing myself in the most recent trends and algorithms within AI. My primary concentration was on exploring and developing various business use cases associated with Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>

           <p>I'm in the final stages of creating a personal assistant tailored to enhance my productivity as a data scientist. The initial demonstration will be ready in the upcoming days.</p>

           <p>Prior to that, I constructed various applications to familiarize myself with diverse language models (LLMs) and technologies, laying the foundation for the development of my personal assistant.</p>

           <h3>Text Classifier App</h3><br>

           <p>We are now going to create the chatbot app using the Mistral 7b Instruct model, a large language model fine-tuned for following instructions. We are going to access it through the Hugging Face API.</p>

           <p>We are going to deploy de chatbt as a Gradio app using an space in Hugging Face. You can use the chatbot in this  <a>href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/franhinomut/Chatbot-Mistral-7b" target="_blank"> link</a></p>
           
           
           <p>Gradio is an open source Python library that allows you to create interactive web-based interfaces for machine learning models quickly and easily.</>
