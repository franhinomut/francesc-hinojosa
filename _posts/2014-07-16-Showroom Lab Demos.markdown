description: <p>I was responsible for managing the technology showroom at NTT DATA's Innovation Lab in Barcelona. My role involved the integration, development and implementation of various proof-of-concepts (PoC) using emerging technologies.</p><p>The two most prominent projects in which I was actively involved were the <b>"Branch of the Future"</b> or <b>"Phygital Space"</b> and the <b>"Digital Human Avatar"</b>.</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <h3>Branch of the Future</h3><br>
            <br>
            <p>I designed and built a showroom that mimics a modern, multi-sector office of the future (Banking, Insurance, Retail and Public Sector). </p>
            
           <p> The showroom features various use cases and utilizes <b>artificial intelligence, data analytics, computer vision, virtual and augmented reality, facial and emotion recognition </b>, and other cutting-edge technologies in a phygital space.</p>

           <br> 
           <h4>Pre-Entry</h4>
           <p><b>Facial recognition</b> to segment visitors by age, gender and emotional state in order to show them an ad on a screen based on these inputs.</p>

            <br> 
           <h4>Entry</h4>
           <p><b>Facial identification</b> for user onboarding. If the user was a registered user, a personalised message is presented on a screen.</p>

            <br> 
           <h4>Prompt service</h4>
           <p>Developing and overseeing bespoke <b>virtual agents</b> suited to various business needs across a range of digital channels using  NTT DATA's in-house platform, eva.</p>

           <br> 
           <h4>Command Center</h4>
           <p>Monitoring traffic in the various areas of the office to obtain <b>flow heat maps</b> by age, gender and time zone.</p>

           <br><p><b>Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Microsoft Azure, Python, eva (NTT DATA conversational AI platform)</b></p>

           <hr></hr>
            <h3>Digital Human Avatar</h3><br>
            <br>
             

            <p><img class="img-responsive" src="img/Digital Human Avatar.png" alt="profile-pic"></p>

            <br>
            <p> A <b>Digital Human Avatar</b> is a computer-generated virtual representation of a human being that can be used for various purposes, such as customer service, digital influencers, and virtual events.</p>

            <P>My involvement in the project was to create several use cases using NTT DATA's proprietary platform, eva, for the creation of virtual agents and to improve the <b>speech-to-text</b>.</p>

            <p>The solution was set up on a digital interactive kiosk, showcasing a human avatar on the screen. It comprised several components such as a visual representation of sound waves (spectra) when a user spoke, an engaged listening system, voice recognition displaying text on the screen, and an information section.</p>
