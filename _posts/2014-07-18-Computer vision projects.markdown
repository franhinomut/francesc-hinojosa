description: <h3>Automatic Number Plate Recognition</h3><br>
    <p>During my tenure as CTO at <a href="https://www.innovagroupbcn.com/" target="_blank">Innova Systems Group</a>, 
    I successfully orchestrated a full-fledged solution for automatic number plate reading. Our dominance in the Spanish market was evident with the deployment of over 2,000 readers across public and private access control, along with traffic monitoring applications.</p>
    <p>The most emblematic parking facilities that we installed were the new terminal T1 Barcelona Airport, the network of car parks BSM (Barcelona Municipal Services) and SABA in Barcelona, the headquarters of Bank of Spain, Iberdrola, Securitas Direct, Sanitas and the parking of the Mexico City International Airport.</p><br><p><b>Deep Learning, Computer Vision, OpenCV, SQL Server, C#, C++, Delphi</b></p>
    <br><hr></hr><br><h3>ViCoMo</h3><br><p>The ITEA 4 <a href="https://itea4.org/project/vicomo.html" target="_blank">ViCoMo</a> (Visual Context Modelling) project set out to find the context of events captured by cameras or image sensors, and model the context so as to establish reliable reasoning about an event.</p><br><p>The ViCoMo work packages produced three main innovations, multi-camera and dynamic
    analysis, 3D environment modelling and the successful integration of new marketing concepts and emerging technologies.</p>
    <br><p>Innova Systems Group participated in the port terminal demonstration, improving the monitoring and tracking techniques of cargo throughout the harbour using vision computing algorithms.</p><br><p><b>Computer Vision, OpenCV, C++</b></p>
